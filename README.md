# VoltorbFlip-Calc

More optimal calc for [Voltorb Flip](https://www.mwyann.fr/voltorbflip.html), that:

1.  Optimizes for overall win chance instead of the safest tile possible

2.  Provides a better estimate for tile utility than raw voltorb rate even if we don't have the time to execute (1).

WIP; next steps are:

1.  Rewriting so that we can run complex boards with lower accuracy instead of guessing their difficulty before DFS'ing (which has proven to be quite difficult).

2. Getting this up on a web page or something when completed
