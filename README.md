# VoltorbFlip-Calc

More optimal calc for Voltorb Flip, that:

1.  Optimizes for overall win chance instead of the safest tile possible

2.  Provides a better estimate for tile utility than raw voltorb rate even if we don't have the time to execute (1).

WIP; next steps are:

1.  Rewriting so that we can run complex boards with lower accuracy instead of guessing their difficulty before DFS'ing (which has proven to be quite difficult).

2.  Sanitizing the program so it is presentable for the time being

3. Getting this up on a web page or something when completed
